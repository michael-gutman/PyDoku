# sudoku-solver
A simple python project to solve 9x9 sudoku puzzles using backtracking.
Simple, although not very efficient.

TODO:
- ~~Find 'Neighbours'~~
- ~~Validate 'Neighbours'~~
- ~~Search for Solution~~
- Make faster

TODO - Enhancements:
- Find a good way to get puzzles as input/build puzzles
- Implement either GUI or web
- Solving for other size puzzles
- Use a more efficient algorithm
